# DND Player Setup Notes
These are the player setup notes for my online 5ed campaigns.

## Requirements
All of these are free/freemium.  The free accounts will work for the campaigns.

- Mic/Headset/Speakers/etc.  (no video)
- Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox)
- Beyond 20 Plugin for your Browser: https://beyond20.here-for-more.info/install
- D&D Beyond Account: https://www.dndbeyond.com
- Roll20 Account: https://roll20.net

## How To Do Stuff

### Learning to Play / Learning 5ed
It will take about 30 minutes to learn to play, and it's easy enough to learn as we go.

* If you want, you can read this: https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf
* If you create a D&D Beyond account and join the campaign I can share my digital books with you.  Note that my digital books will have more classes and races not available in the basic rules above.
* There is a slight learning curve with using the virtual table top (Roll20) and interacting with it from your character sheet (in D&D Beyond).

### Table Top
We will use Roll20 as a virtual table top for encounters / dungeons (and rolling).

### Rolling
You don't need dice.  D&D Beyond allows you to make rolls and it will share them automatically (via Beyond20).
